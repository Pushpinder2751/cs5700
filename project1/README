#1. This is the first project of CS5700. It is intended to
familiarize students with writing simple network code.
The server will ask your program to solve hundreds of simple
mathematical expressions. If your program successfully solves
all of the expressions, then the server will return a secret flag
that is unique for each student.

#2. I have attempted extra credit as well, the problem with SSL
was how to properly write about the certificates.

#3. The function to solve the mathematical expressions is pretty
straight forward.

#4. Talking to server is just a while loop which exits if there is
an error or a 'BYE' message from the server.

#5. I tested my code with cs5700sp16.ccs.neu.edu since cs5700f16.ccs.neu.edu
was not working. However, for default, I am now using cs5700.ccs.neu.edu
