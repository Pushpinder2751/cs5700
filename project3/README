This is a project which works with network Simulator (NS2), generates data(throughput, end-to-end latency , drop rate)
for different variants of TCP(Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas)

I have used an external file to parse(nstrace.py) the trace files which can be found here :
http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/html/auxiliary_files/ns2/nstrace.py

Experiment 1 : TCP Performance Under Congestion

In this experiment we try to study the as a function of CBR(Constant bit rate)
The data(throughput, end-to-end latency , drop rate) for each TCP variant vs different
CBR rates(1-10)mb is generated and then analyzed.

We have a Generic TCL file and a python file which generate the tr(trace files)
and csv files for later analysis.

To run exp1 :
1. make
2. python exp1.py

This will create trace files in the folder trace_files/1_exp folder and
csv files in csv_files/1_exp folder.

To remove the files just type make clean

Experiment 2: Fairness Between TCP Variants

In this experiment we try to study how different TCP variants perform and provide
fairness in presence of other TCP variants and CBR flow.

to run exp2:
1. make
2. python exp2.py

This will create trace files in the folder trace_files/2_exp folder and
csv files in csv_files/2_exp folder.

To remove the files just type: make clean


Experiment 3: Influence of Queuing

Queuing disciplines like DropTail and Random Early Drop (RED) are algorithms
that control how packets in a queue are treated. In these experiments, instead
 of varying the rate of the CBR flow, we study the influence of the queuing
 discipline used by nodes on the overall throughput of flows.

 to run exp3:
 1. make
 2. python exp3.py

 This will create trace files in the folder trace_files/3_exp folder and
 csv files in csv_files/3_exp folder.

 To remove the files just type: make clean

Problems faced :

1. Creating and saving data in the right format was a challenge. I chose csv so that
it is easy for us to generate graphs in excel or even R.

2. We had to generate the graphs to confirm that the data being generated is legit.
