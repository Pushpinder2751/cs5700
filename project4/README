Project 4 : Raw Sockets

Objective :

The objective of this project is to download a file from the server using raw sockets.
These sockets bypass Layer 2,3,4 of the network stack and builds TCP as well as IP Headers.
There were 3 major parts:

Building the TCP Header
Building the IP Header
Handling HTTP

Running the program :

1. make sure you are running sudo, as we need this for raw packets
2. run make
3. run ./rawhttpget URL
4. check the downloaded file by comparing it with wget the same URL and doing diff 

Challenges:
1. Getting the handshake right
2. handling retransmissoins from the server
3. checksum handling
