Project 4 : Raw Sockets

Objective :

The objective of this project is to download a file from the server using raw sockets.
These sockets bypass Layer 2,3,4 of the network stack and builds TCP as well as IP Headers.
There were 3 major parts:

Building the TCP Header
Building the IP Header
Handling HTTP

Design :

Since the program was quite large, it made sense to segregate it into multiple files.
* All the things related to IP header are in the file ip.py, this includes a class
which takes in all the arguments, constructing the IP header string from the class
and re-constructing it from the string to a class, printing the packet details
for debugging.
* All the things related to TCP header are in the file tcp.py, this includes a class
which takes in all the arguments, constructing the TCP header string from the class
and re-constructing it from the string to a class, printing the packet details
for debugging.
* utility.py has all the basic functions.
  

Running the program :

1. make sure you are running sudo, as we need this for raw packets
2. run make
3. run ./rawhttpget URL
4. check the downloaded file by comparing it with wget the same URL and doing diff

Challenges:
1. Getting the handshake right
2. handling retransmissoins from the server
3. checksum handling
